ASSOCIATE EDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION

 There was also a strong sense that the link between the model itself and the CSR scheme is somewhat unclear, with the verbal argument only loosely related to the model.

Reviewer #1:


The different parts of the paper are somewhat disconnected; first, the model is presented and analyzed; then comes an invasion analysis, the conclusions of which do not really differ from what is obtained with a classical lottery model (a mutant fares better if it has a lower death rate / higher fecundity / higher competitive ability); finally, connections are made with the different types of strategies described in Grime's triangle, and illustrations are given for large but also vague clades of organisms (fishes, corals, plants). But no part appears essential to the other ones. Take for instance Figure 4 (a table). The modified lottery model allows the consideration of cases with low density; in this case competitive ability does not matter, so there is no selection for changes in competitive ability. There is not really a need for a detailed model to reach this verbal conclusion... What Figure (/table) 4 also shows is that a parameter that is constrained does not evolve
(e.g., Ideal column, d has to be <<1, it cannot change). Again, there is no need for a complicated model to obtain this result...


It is not really clear what eqs (6) and (7) bring to the study, because they are not much interpreted (except to say when the terms vanish).

The empirical examples given at the end of the Results section are too vague to be relevant.

Line 317 Where does this 1% figure come from?

Line 411-412 It could be useful to expand on this.

Reviewer #2:

From page 15 onwards, the authors infer the evolution of fecundity (b), mortality (d) and competitive ability (c) in ideal/disturbed/stressful environments as in Grime's triangle. The summary table in Figure 4 is based on a verbal argument. 

The only link to the preceding model seems to be that in low-density environments, competitive ability is unimportant - which is immediately obvious and generalizes way beyond the concrete model. 

The verbal argument of this main part is weak. 

Essentially, it says that b and c should increase whereas d should decrease (as it is obvious), except when c is unimportant (density is low), or when d cannot decrease further (presumably this is why it is not expected to evolve in the ideal environment, although doubling a lifetime is good even if it's already long), or when b cannot increase by definition (this is how the authors define a stressful environment). We do not need any model to be able to say this much. 

Life-history trade-offs are intentionally missing from the argument. Moreover, equating disturbance to a constant high mortality is doubtful, and the definition of a stressful environment is also problematic so that the authors use actually two different definitions in Figure 4.
