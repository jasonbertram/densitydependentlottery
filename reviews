 However after reading the paper, I felt that the effort stopped short of demonstrating what new insight could be gained from the formalization you offer. Both reviewers converged on a similar conclusion that although your approach can recapitulate aspects of Grimes ideas, the inferences you draw from it are not novel or surprising and are, in any case, based primarily on verbal arguments, making the model seem superfluous.

ASSOCIATE EDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION

 There was also a strong sense that the link between the model itself and the CSR scheme is somewhat unclear, with the verbal argument only loosely related to the model.

Reviewer #1:


The different parts of the paper are somewhat disconnected; first, the model is presented and analyzed; then comes an invasion analysis, the conclusions of which do not really differ from what is obtained with a classical lottery model (a mutant fares better if it has a lower death rate / higher fecundity / higher competitive ability); finally, connections are made with the different types of strategies described in Grime's triangle, and illustrations are given for large but also vague clades of organisms (fishes, corals, plants). But no part appears essential to the other ones. Take for instance Figure 4 (a table). The modified lottery model allows the consideration of cases with low density; in this case competitive ability does not matter, so there is no selection for changes in competitive ability. There is not really a need for a detailed model to reach this verbal conclusion... What Figure (/table) 4 also shows is that a parameter that is constrained does not evolve
(e.g., Ideal column, d has to be <<1, it cannot change). Again, there is no need for a complicated model to obtain this result...



- The distribution of numbers of propagules of a given type are said to be given by a product of independent Poisson distributions (Appendix A, line 605). There needs to be a better justification for this claim given how the model is constructed; the Poisson limit theorem deals with binomial distribution, not a multinomial. Also, the conditions under which this is a valid approximation could be clearer (see e.g. Deheuvels & Pfeifer 1988, "Poisson approximations of multinomial distributions and point processes")



- The decomposition presented in eq. (5) is useful in that it helps understand the consequences of different levels of propagule density. However, eq. (5) in the main text is presented as if the decomposition was obtained after lines of calculations, while it is assumed from the start (Appendix B). This should be clearer.

It is not really clear what eqs (6) and (7) bring to the study, because they are not much interpreted (except to say when the terms vanish).

- Details of the simulations are missing. What is the underlying model? (multinomial or Poisson?) What is the value of T? How many replicates are there?

The invasion analysis is not a proper invasion analysis, as hinted at around line 267.

The empirical examples given at the end of the Results section are too vague to be relevant.

Other comments
lines 120-122 Presenting/discussing a potential feature that is actually not used may confuse the reader.



Figure 2: the figure looks like there is isolation by distance (only two black trees send propagules to the bottom right-hand cell), while this does not seem to be the case in the model.

Line 189 No I think it is already long enough

Line 317 Where does this 1% figure come from?

Line 411-412 It could be useful to expand on this.

Reviewer #2:

Directed dispersal

From page 15 onwards, the authors infer the evolution of fecundity (b), mortality (d) and competitive ability (c) in ideal/disturbed/stressful environments as in Grime's triangle. The summary table in Figure 4 is based on a verbal argument. The only link to the preceding model seems to be that in low-density environments, competitive ability is unimportant - which is immediately obvious and generalizes way beyond the concrete model. The verbal argument of this main part is weak. Essentially, it says that b and c should increase whereas d should decrease (as it is obvious), except when c is unimportant (density is low), or when d cannot decrease further (presumably this is why it is not expected to evolve in the ideal environment, although doubling a lifetime is good even if it's already long), or when b cannot increase by definition (this is how the authors define a stressful environment). We do not need any model to be able to say this much. Life-history trade-offs are
intentionally missing from the argument. Moreover, equating disturbance to a constant high mortality is doubtful, and the definition of a stressful environment is also problematic so that the authors use actually two different definitions in Figure 4.
